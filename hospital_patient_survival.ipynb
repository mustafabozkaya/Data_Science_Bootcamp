A, B, C, D, E, F and Z are the previous conditions of the patient. Suppose for one patient, if the entry in column A is 1, it means that the previous condition of the patient was A. If the patient didn't have that condition, it is 0 and same for other conditions. If a patient has previous condition as A and C , columns A and C will have entries as 1 and 1 respectively while the other column B, D, E, F, Z will have entries 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 respectively. The column Number_of_prev_cond will have entry as 2 i.e. 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 2 in this case. )\n",
